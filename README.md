# Read Me File for Git Practice

This is my pratice markdown document. Let's see what I remember from a few days ago.

## What I remember
- The intuitive stuff, such as bulleted lists
- Um, *italics* with their single asterisks on each side
- **Bold** with its double aserisks on each side
- Making a line break with a line break

## What I've forgotten
- Making a [link](http://www.chapin.edu) though I did remember not to put a space between the bracketed display text and the parenthetical url
