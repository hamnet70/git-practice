# Practice Markdown Document

## Questioning Markdown
I'm not quite sure I agree that markdown (so far) is any more human friendly than HTML. At least the code has some signifier such as H1 for heading and img src for image source. 

The following don't seem like obvious connections:
- Hash tags for headings
- Double hash tags for subheadings
- Asterisks for *italics*
- Double askerisks for **bold**
- Bracketed display text and no-space parenthetical urls
- Knowing to include a space after the hashtags

What does seem more intuitive than HTML is:
- Hyphens on separate lines to indicate bullets
- A line break to indicate a line break
- A line space to indicate paragraph breaks
- Triple has tags for sub subheadings (once you've got the single and double learned)

I appreciate, though, what I'm learning from [this tutorial](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/markdown.md).

Though Markdown may not be wowing me, I'm certainly wowed by git, which promises to get me one step closer to my goal of adopting habits that lead to clean projects. (Having said that, I do love the Visual Code interface here, with the preview to my right.)
